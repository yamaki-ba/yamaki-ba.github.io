			</p> 
            <a href="#" class="fwn">Supply Chain Analytics</a>
			<p> At its core, Supply chain management is all about matching supply and demand. 
				In order to design an efficient supply chain, the first step is to forecast the demand.  </p> 
			<p> We help you answer the three main questions in this demand process. </p>
			<p><em> Demand Planning:</em> What should we do to create product demand (KPIs of the five Ps)?  </p>
			<p><em> Forecasting Demand:</em>  If we adopt the particular demand creation plan, what do we expect the demand to be? 
											The answer to this question lies in making forecasts with high degree of confidence. </p>
			<p><em> Demand Management:</em> Given this demand forecast, how do we prepare and act when it starts materializing? 
											The answer to this question balances the demand and supply across the organization.</p>

			<a href="#">Identifying the Push-Pull Boundary</a>
			</span>
			</p> 
            <a href="#" class="fwn">Supply Chain Analytics</a>
			<p> While managing supply chains, managers evaluate the point or boundary where the supply chain changes 
				from being a push to a pull - which is sometimes called the push/pull boundary, or the push/pull point. 
				This is the place where the inventory management switches from one based on a forecast to actual demand. </p>
			<p> The decision is critical because for the same operations and same products it involves totally different supply chains. </p>

			<a href="#">Segmentation</a>
			</span>
			</p> 
            <a href="#" class="fwn">Supply Chain Analytics</a>
			<p> In reality, no firm operates a single supply chain - whether they realize it or not. </p>
			<p> Firms need to clearly segment their products, customers, and suppliers so that they can 
				treat them in a better manner, whether it's more efficiently or more effectively.  </p>
			<p>	We help you measure three main dimensions to segment on: 
			<ul>
				<li> the physical characteristics,</li> 
				<li>the demand characteristics, and the </li> 
				<li> supply characteristics. </li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p> Segmentation is not a static decision but needs to be dynamic in tandem with the acceleration or 
				decelaration of the product velocity and other mix characterstics due to seasonality or changing trends. 
				Our models help you maintain the optimal balance at all times.  </p>

			<a href="#">ABC Analysis</a>
			</span>
			</p> 
            <a href="#" class="fwn">Supply Chain Analytics</a>
			<p> The most common way that segmentation is done for products, is using something called an ABC Analysis. </p>
			<p> In reality, there is a significant amount of arbitrariness at the boundaries and decisions made there 
				can have significant impact on profitability. We may need to have class D, E, F, double F, triple F depending on the length of the tail. </p> 
			<p> The supply chains evolve over time. As the products change, as the customers change, the way you service them, 
				your supply chain, will evolve. So there's no single best practice that lasts forever. 
				Things change, and as those things change, your supply chain needs to adjust.  </p>
