            <p>In analytics, it’s easy to get lost in the process of setting up the environment. 
      Managers get tied up in making specific tools of the ecosystem work, and before they know it 
      months pass and they haven’t yet answered the questions they started with. </p>
      Having a partner is an invaluable asset that lets you focus on 
      the goal and hides away the steps required to reach your goals.
