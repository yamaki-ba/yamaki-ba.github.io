In today’s connected world everyone is obsessed with technology. For many consumers, the e-commerce has become a way of life. Because of our growing dependence on the online world, businesses everywhere are ensuring that they have active, engaging and user-friendly websites.

Let’s understand the components of Website Analytics, which broadly categorises data into the *ABCs*:

1.    Acquisition
2.    Audience
3.    Behavior
4.    Conversions

## Acquisition

Acquisition refers to how the website traffic is generated. This provides the most important data like the number of sessions acquired, the bounce rate of those acquired visitors, and their conversions for most effective channels.

Acquisition report is a great to look at which avenues are best for bringing traffic to your site and getting certain actions to happen. For example, if you want to know

1.  What are the top channels that brings traffic to your website? Examples: Direct, Organic, Referral, Social
2.  Which search engine is driving the most organic traffic? Examples: Google, Bing, Yahoo, Ask.com, Others
3.  What is the total number of Sessions, Users, Pageviews, Pages/Sessions, New User and Avg. Time Durations?
4.  Which referral sources are responsible for driving the most traffic? Examples: Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Reddit, Twitter
5.  What are the organic keywords that users search in Search engines which generates organic traffic?
6.  Which campaigns are performing in terms of acquiring customers?
7.  Which are the exit pages and is there any trend in it?

This information can be used to make decisions about where to promote content. For example, if Facebook is driving a significant amount of people to your site, work on publishing content there.

## Audience

Understanding your audience is pivotal for any business. It will allow to improve your practices and increase your customer loyalty and retention. The Audience Section allows to know more about who makes up your website traffic. This section emphasizes demographics and attributes tied to the traffic.

Few important questions related to audience of your website are:

2.  What is the age group of your audience?
3.  What is the Gender breakup of your audience?
4.  Which are the languages in which people interact with your website?
5.  Which locations have high sessions but low conversions rate?
6.  What are the numbers of new users and returning users?
7.  How frequently user returns to website?

## Behavior

The Behavior reports all about seeing what visitors are doing on the website. It can be used to assess the performance of the website content and determine if the visitors are taking the actions you want them to. It shows where your users come into your site, where they go next, and when they drop off. If majority of your users dropping off after visiting a certain type of page, then that page has to be critically examined and either eliminated or overhaul it.

It shows total amount of traffic in a given period along with pageviews, unique pageviews, average time on page, bounce rate metrics, and percent exit metrics. All these metrics describe how a user interacted with the page.

For example, if you want to know:

2.  What are top contents of website? Examples: Blogs, News, Videos
3.  Which web page has more visitors compared to another?
