        <h4>Breakthrough insights from advanced analytics can only be unleashed by combining data analytics and data science experts 
          with latest tools and technology working on carefully chosen use cases to deliver measurable results.

          <p class="fwn"> 
              We focus on three inter-related work streams: Big Data Research, Advanced Data Analytics and Data Pipeline Integration.
              To deliver, we build a multi-disciplinary team with required CxO level experience, data science expertise and knowledge of 
              latest platforms and tools. 
          </p>

          <p class="fwn"> 
              Every client has a unique operating environment which makes every analytics project unique. 
              Our team members hold advanced academic qualifications and backgrounds in a range of 
              complementary fields. Bizness Analytis can act as a single use case advisor, implementor 
              alongside your team for key tasks, or provide fully managed solution providing end to end support.

            As companies adopt data acquisition tools in every department, their analysis capabilities 
            are falling short and making it difficult to unlock data's full potential.

              The existing and new data solutions are moving to primarily cloud based services. However, the ability
              of companies to extract and load data across sources is preventing them from generating insights.

            <p class="fwn"> 
                We can assist you from planning, re-designing and executing an effective and integrated data pipeline
                to transform into lever of success.

          <p class="fwn"> Real world company data has many inaccuracies and inconsistencies. The data lies in silos 
            of legacy IT systems and may have different schema and formats. </p>
          <p class="fwn"> There are missing information, data entry errors, duplicate entries, wrong entries and other 
              inconsistencies. </p>  
          <p class="fwn"> We design and deploy bespoke solutions using automated text mining, fuzzy matching and other 
              state-of-the-art algorithms. By combining automated and semi-automated processes, an otherwise overwhelming 
              administrative task is converted into a focused task that adds immediate value. </p>

            <div class="text1"><a href="#">Break Data Silos</a></div>
            <p class="fwn">Proliferation of IT systems and SaaS systems has created data fragmentation 
            across organizations. As a result, analytics and reporting has become a nightmare. Self service tools
            with multiple input data connectors don't live upto expectations. The organizations need
            data stitching to let the silos talk to each other. </p>  

            <p class="fwn"> Having a centralized and normalized data allows for discovery of insights across silos. 
              It allows the company to maintain consistent KPIs across the organization, and perform quick analysis on 
            important questions.</p> 

            <p class="fwn"> We help you stitch your data sources, whether legacy on-premise or cloud based, into 
              a single data pipeline that can be fed into your data visualization tools.</p>

              <div class="text1"><a href="#">Seamlessly Integrate Artificial Intelligence</a></div>
              <p class="fwn"> Technology firms have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence and Machine Learning
              over the years. These systems drive their internal sytems however are also being increasingly shared with developers
              and data scientists. </p>

            <p class="fwn"> We can help you add state-of-the-art intelligence to your business processes  with a diverse 
              selection of pre-trained services that provide predictions, forecasting, segmentation, clustering, recommendation engines, 
              computer vision, speech, language analysis, chatbot functionality or others to your use cases. </p>

                <p class="fwn"> For most use cases, the Data Pipeline goes through transformation of query results in 
                  a series of intuitive steps, gets treated by machine learning algorithms and ends up in visualizations
                  that allows non data scientists to easily identify trends, patterns and outliers. </p>

                <p class="fwn"> We can design powerful visualizations leveraging full power of the visualization tools 
                  such as data blending, drill downs, table joins, custom schemas, extrapolation, snapshots, data sharing,
                  alerts, admin and much more. </p>
