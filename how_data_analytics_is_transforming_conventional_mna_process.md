title: How Data Analytics is Transforming Tradtional M&A Process
layout: pages
---

Data forms bedrock of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) process. The M&A decisions tend to be transformatory in nature, largely irreversible and unforgiving for mistakes mades. Still, the timeframes are almost always tight and resources get stretched. Most of the time gets spent on collecting and organizing data and only limited insights come out. The problem is more pronounced in the Middle Market where both the seller and buyer are grossly underprepared.

More often than not, the decision makers blend a healthy amount of 'gut-feel' into the limited visibility that they hold and make crutial transformative decisions. They do not come to know the real story behind the numbers until they are in midst of post-deal transition.

## Regular challenges of middle market M&A
* Advisors are 'process experts' and not 'sector experts': do not possess 'deep' sector knowledge.
* Source data (generally management accounts, statutory accounts, general ledger etc.) tend to be high level devoid of insights. 
* Analysts do not get benefit of adequate macro and micro economic data to make sophisticated models: models tend to be simple with few variables.
* Timelines are squeezed and the process needs to run quickly with barely couple of weeks available. 
* Management has a day job besides managing the M&A process and are available only intermittently.
* Finance and accounts staff does not have much time, and at times skills, to prepare reports required for the M&A analysis.
* A variety of IT systems used by the company for MIS, ERP, Inventory... resulting in disjointed data posing reconciliation issues.
* The entire set of data - internal and external - for a proper anlaysis is too big for excel based modelling.

## Conventional Data Handling Process
### Management accounts collected from the company
* Typically the reports collected include historical audited and management financials, high level descriptive metrics on manufacturing, products, distribution and/ or sales. 
* Most of the valuable data of the company is locked in department disjointed IT systems and cannot be shared in a form that presents insights. 

### Processing and reconciliation of data
* A variety of IT systems used by the company for MIS, ERP, Inventory, Payroll, Accounts result in disjointed data posing reconciliation issues.
* Companies do not analyze most of their internal data.
* Companies generally do not possess context data for their internal data
* The entire set of data, internal and external, for a proper anlaysis is too big for excel based modelling.

### Findings accumulated and summarized
* Final output provides limited insights into the company since it is based on 'high level' management and statutory reports.
* It is primarily used to produce customary documentation.
